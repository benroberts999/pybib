We show in particular that isotopes of La 2+, Ac 2+ and Th 3+ ions have strong potential in the search for new physics beyond the standard model - the PNC amplitudes are large, the calculations are accurate and the nuclei are practically stable. In addition, 232-Th 3+ ions have recently been trapped and cooled [C. J. Campbell et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 233004 (2009)]. We also extend previous works by calculating the s-s PNC transitions in Ra + and Ba +, and provide new calculations of several energy levels, and electric dipole and quadrupole transition amplitudes for the Fr-like actinide ions.},

abstract = {We propose methods and present calculations that can be used to search for evidence of cosmic fields by investigating the parity-violating effects, including parity nonconservation amplitudes and electric dipole moments, that they induce in atoms. The results are used to constrain important fundamental parameters describing the strength of the interaction of various cosmic fields with electrons, protons, and neutrons. Candidates for such fields are dark matter (including axions) and dark energy, as well as several more exotic sources described by standard-model extensions. Existing parity nonconservation experiments in Cs, Dy, Yb, and Tl are combined with our calculations to directly place limits on the interaction strength between the temporal component, b_0, of a static pseudovector cosmic field and the atomic electrons, with the most stringent limit of |b_0^e| < 7*10^(-15) GeV, in the laboratory frame of reference, coming from Dy. From a measurement of the nuclear anapole moment of Cs, and a limit on its value for Tl, we also extract limits on the interaction strength between the temporal component of this cosmic field, as well as a related tensor cosmic-field component d_00, with protons and neutrons. The most stringent limits of |b_0^p| < 4*10^(-8) GeV and |d_00^p| < 5*10^(-8) for protons, and |b_0^n| < 2*10^(-7) GeV and |d_00^n| < 2*10^(-7) for neutrons (in the laboratory frame) come from the results using Cs. Axions may induce oscillating P- and T-violating effects in atoms and molecules through the generation of oscillating nuclear magnetic quadrupole and Schiff moments, which arise from P- and T-odd intranuclear forces and from the electric dipole moments of constituent nucleons. Nuclear-spin-independent parity nonconservation effects may be enhanced in diatomic molecules possessing close pairs of opposite-parity levels in the presence of time-dependent interactions.},

Parity nonconservation in these systems is greatly enhanced due to the presence of very close electronic energy levels of opposite parity, large nuclear charge, and strong nuclear enhancement of parity-violating effects. The presented amplitudes constitute several of the largest atomic parity-violating signals predicted so far. Experiments using these systems may be performed to determine values for the nuclear anapole moment, a P-odd T-even nuclear moment given rise to by parity-violating nuclear forces. Such measurements may prove to be valuable tools in the study of parity violation in the hadron sector. The considered spin- independent transitions could also be used to measure the ratio of weak charges for different isotopes of the same atom, the results of which would serve as a test of the standard model and also of neutron distributions. Barium, with seven stable isotopes, is particularly promising in this regard.},

These variations can be sought for with atomic clock, laser interferometer and pulsar timing measurements.

abstract = {Atoms and molecules can become ionized during the scattering of a slow, heavy particle off a bound electron. Such an interaction involving leptophilic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is a promising possible explanation for the anomalous 9 sigma annual modulation in the DAMA dark matter direct detection experiment [R. Bernabei et al., Eur. Phys. J. C 73, 2648 (2013)]. We demonstrate the applicability of the Born approximation for such an interaction by showing its equivalence to the semiclassical adiabatic treatment of atomic ionization by slow-moving WIMPs. Conventional wisdom has it that the ionization probability for such a process should be exponentially small. We show, however, that due to nonanalytic, cusp-like behaviour of Coulomb functions close to the nucleus this suppression is removed, leading to an effective atomic structure enhancement. Crucially, we also show that electron relativistic effects actually give the dominant contribution to such a process, enhancing the differential cross section by up to 1000 times.},

abstract = {A huge effort from scientists all around the world has pushed tests of physics to ever higher energy scales (e.g. at CERN), though no trace of non-standard model physics has yet been found. In this thesis, I explore another avenue: the use of high precision atomic physics to study fundamental interactions at low energy. I present new calculations of parity-violating effects in atoms. I consider several approaches, including exploiting the very high accuracy that is possible in simple systems, the very large effects that can be found in more complex systems, and studying processes that are sensitive to hadronic parity violation. Then, I consider the interaction of atoms with various background “cosmic” fields. Candidates for such fields include dark matter (e.g. axions) and physics described by extensions to the standard model. By combining my calculations with existing experimental results, new limits on several parameters of physics beyond the standard model are set. I then consider the specific case of axion dark matter in detail. I calculate several new effects that an axion field would induce in atoms. Crucially, these effects are linear in the axion interaction strength; most current search tech- niques are based on effects that are at least quadratic in this (extremely small) parameter. Finally, I consider the interaction of WIMPs with electrons in regard to to dark matter detection experiments. A very promising claim of a positive detec- tion of WIMPs was made by the DAMA Collaboration. This result is the only long-standing claim for a positive WIMP detection, and electron-interacting WIMPs are the lead candidate. I demonstrate that relativistic effects give the dominant contribution to such processes, meaning that non-relativistic calcu- lations may underestimate the cross section by many orders of magnitude; all previous calculations were performed using non-relativistic wavefunctions. I em- ploy accurate relativistic methods to calculate model-independent cross sections and event rates. By assuming the DAMA signal is due to WIMPs, I calculate the signal that would be expected in another experiment, XENON. By compar- ing this to the observations of the XENON Collaboration, I entirely rule out electron-interacting WIMPs as the source of the DAMA signal.},

abstract = {We revisit the WIMP-type dark matter scattering on electrons that results in atomic ionization, and can manifest itself in a variety of existing direct-detection experiments. Unlike the WIMP-nucleon scattering, where current experiments probe typical interaction strengths much smaller than the Fermi constant, the scattering on electrons requires a much stronger interaction to be detectable, which in turn requires new light force carriers. We account for such new forces explicitly, by introducing a mediator particle with scalar or vector couplings to dark matter and to electrons. We then perform state of the art numerical calculations of atomic ionization relevant to the existing experiments. Our goals are to consistently take into account the atomic physics aspect of the problem (e.g., the relativistic effects, which can be quite significant), and to scan the parameter space: the dark matter mass, the mediator mass, and the effective coupling strength, to see if there is any part of the parameter space that could potentially explain the DAMA modulation signal. While we find that the modulation fraction of all events with energy deposition above 2 keV in NaI can be quite significant, reaching $\sim$50%, the relevant parts of the parameter space are excluded by the XENON10 and XENON100 experiments.},

abstract = {Cosmological observations indicate that 85% of all matter in the Universe is dark matter (DM), yet its microscopic composition remains a mystery. One hypothesis is that DM arises from ultralight quantum fields that form macroscopic objects such as topological defects. Here we use GPS as a $\sim$ 50,000 km aperture DM detector to search for such defects in the form of domain walls. GPS navigation relies on precision timing signals furnished by atomic clocks hosted on board GPS satellites. As the Earth moves through the galactic DM halo, interactions with topological defects could cause atomic clock glitches that propagate through the GPS satellite constellation at galactic velocities $\sim$ 300 km/s. Mining 16 years of archival GPS data, we find no evidence for DM in the form of domain walls at our current sensitivity level. This allows us to improve the limits on certain quadratic scalar couplings of domain wall DM to standard model particles by several orders of magnitude.},

In particular, we consider the atomic clocks of the Global Positioning System (GPS), consisting of a constellation of 32 medium-Earth orbit satellites equipped with either Cs or Rb microwave clocks and a number of Earth-based receiver stations, some of which employ highly-stable H-maser atomic clocks. High-accuracy timing data is available for almost two decades. By analyzing the satellite and terrestrial atomic clock data, it is possible to search for transient signatures of exotic physics, such as "clumpy" dark matter and dark energy, effectively transforming the GPS constellation into a 50,000km aperture sensor array. Here we characterize the noise of the GPS satellite atomic clocks, describe the search method based on Bayesian statistics, and test the method using simulated clock data. We present the projected discovery reach using our method, and demonstrate that it can surpass the existing constrains by several order of magnitude for certain models. Our method is not limited in scope to GPS or atomic clock networks, and can also be applied to other networks of precision measurement devices.},

abstract = {We investigate the possibility for the direct detection of low mass (GeV scale) WIMP dark matter in scintillation experiments. Such WIMPs are typically too light to leave appreciable nuclear recoils, but may be detected via their scattering off atomic electrons. In particular, the DAMA Collaboration [R. Bernabei et al., Nucl. Phys. At. Energy 19, 307 (2018)] has recently presented strong evidence of an annual modulation in the scintillation rate observed at energies as low as 1 keV. Despite a strong enhancement in the calculated event rate at low energies, we find that an interpretation in terms of electron-interacting WIMPs cannot be consistent with existing constraints. We also demonstrate the importance of correct treatment of the atomic wavefunctions, and show the resulting event rate is very sensitive to the low-energy performance of the detectors, meaning it is crucial that the detector uncertainties be taken into account. Finally, we demonstrate that the potential scintillation event rate can be much larger than may otherwise be expected, meaning that competitive searches can be performed for m_chi $\sim$ 1 GeV scale WIMPs using the conventional prompt (S1) scintillation signals. This is important given the recent and upcoming very large liquid xenon detectors.},

abstract = {We report an experiment that compares the frequency of a clock (an ultra-stable optical cavity in this case) at time $t$ to its own frequency some time $t-T$ earlier, by "storing" the output signal (photons) in a fibre delay line. In ultra-light oscillating dark matter (DM) models such an experiment is sensitive to coupling of DM to the standard model fields, through oscillations of the cavity and fibre lengths and of the fibre refractive index. Additionally, the sensitivity is significantly enhanced around the mechanical resonances of the cavity. We report no evidence of DM for masses in the [$4.1\times 10^{-11}$, $8.3\times 10^{-10}$]$\sim$eV region. In addition, we improve constraints on the involved coupling constants by one order of magnitude in a standard galactic DM model, at the mass corresponding to the resonant frequency of our cavity. In a recently proposed model of a DM relaxation halo around the Earth we improve on existing constraints over the whole DM mass range, by up to 6 orders of magnitude.},

@article{RobertsAsymm2018,
abstract = {Dark matter may be composed of self-interacting ultralight quantum fields that form macroscopic objects. An example of which includes Q-balls, compact non-topological solitons predicted by a range of theories that are viable dark matter candidates. As the Earth moves through the galaxy, interactions with such objects may leave transient perturbations in terrestrial experiments. Here we propose a new dark matter signature: an asymmetry (and other non-Gaussianities) that may thereby be induced in the noise distributions of precision quantum sensors, such as atomic clocks, magnetometers, and interferometers. Further, we demonstrate that there would be a sizeable annual modulation in these signatures due to the annual variation of the Earth velocity with respect to dark matter halo. As an illustration of our formalism, we apply our method to 6 years of data from the atomic clocks on board GPS satellites and place constraints on couplings for macroscopic dark matter objects with radii R<104km, the region that is otherwise inaccessible using relatively sparse global networks.},

We have found significant corrections to two non-dominating terms coming from the contribution of the core and highly excited states ($n>9$, the so called {\em tail}). When these differences are taken into account the result of Porsev {\em et al}, $E_{\rm PNC} = 0.8906\,(24) \times 10^{-11}i(-Q_W/N)$ changes to $0.8977\,(40)$, coming into good agreement with our previous calculations, $0.8980\,(45)$. The interpretation of the PNC measurements in cesium still indicates reasonable agreement with the standard model ($1.5\,\sigma$), however gives new constraints on physics beyond it.},

@article{Roberts2012,
abstract = {The standard model has been extremely successful in its description of nature, however it is widely believed that it is a low energy manifestation of a more complete, unified theory. There are a number of proposed extensions to the standard model and tests must be made to distinguish between them. It is the aim of such tests to reveal, or to constrain, new physics beyond the standard model and differentiate between competing unification theories. Complementary to high energy tests (performed in accelerators, e.g. the Large Hadron Collider at CERN), parity violation measurements can serve as highly accurate tests the low energy sector of the standard model. Measurements of parity violation rely on theoretical calculations for their interpretation. It is the accuracy of these calculations which restrict the conclusions that can be drawn about physics beyond the standard model. In this thesis, we improve the current calculations for parity nonconserva- tion in caesium by adding many-body corrections to two non-dominating terms. This result is used to interpret the most precise parity nonconservation measure- ment in caesium, providing the most accurate low energy test of the electroweak theory to date. After this, new parity violation calculations are performed in several atoms. Significantly, the accuracy for calculations in rubidium is shown to have the potential to surpass those of caesium. This is important because in caesium it is the theoretical uncertainty which limits the use of parity nonconservation as a test of new physics and unification theories. Then, calculations of previously neglected corrections to parity violation calculations arising from strong Coulomb field quantum electrodynamics are performed for several atoms: Rb, Fr, Ra+, Ba+ and Tl. These small corrections are important as the accuracy of atomic physics calculations in these atoms approaches the level already attained in caesium. Results from this work have been accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters.},

We calculate the PNC 5s-6s electric dipole transition amplitude in rubidium and demonstrate that rubidium is a good candidate to search for new physics beyond the standard model since accuracy of the atomic calculations in rubidium can be higher than in cesium. PNC in cesium is currently the best low-energy test of the standard model; therefore, similar measurements for rubidium present a good option for further progress in the field. We also calculate the nuclear spin-dependent part of the PNC amplitude, which is needed for the extraction of the nuclear anapole moment from the PNC measurements.},

abstract = {We report a fourfold improvement in the determination of nuclear magnetic moments for neutron-deficient isotopes of francium-207--213, reducing the uncertainties from 2% for most isotopes to 0.5%. These are found by comparing our high-precision calculations of hyperfine structure constants for the ground states with experimental values. In particular, we show the importance of a careful modeling of the Bohr-Weisskopf effect, which arises due to the finite nuclear magnetization distribution. This effect is particularly large in Fr and until now has not been modeled with sufficiently high accuracy. An improved understanding of the nuclear magnetic moments and Bohr-Weisskopf effect are crucial for benchmarking the atomic theory required in precision tests of the standard model, in particular atomic parity violation studies, that are underway in francium.},

abstract = {We report on our calculations of differential hyperfine anomalies in the nuclear single-particle model for a number of atoms and ions of interest for studies of fundamental symmetries violations. Comparison with available experimental data allows one to discriminate between different nuclear magnetization models, and this data supports the use of the nuclear single-particle model over the commonly-used uniform ball model. Accurate modelling of the nuclear magnetization distribution is important for testing atomic theory through hyperfine comparisons. The magnetization distribution must be adequately understood and modelled, with uncertainties well under the atomic theory uncertainty, for hyperfine comparisons to be meaningful. This has not been the case for a number of atoms of particular interest for precision studies, including Cs. Our work demonstrates the validity of the nuclear single-particle model for Cs, and this has implications for the theory analysis of atomic parity violation in this atom.},
